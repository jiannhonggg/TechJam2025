# TikTok Location Review Policies

## 1. No Advertisements
Reviews should not contain promotional content, URLs, discount codes, or solicitations.
Examples:
- "Check out www.pizzapromo.com for discounts!"
- "Use code SAVE20 to get a deal!"

## 2. No Irrelevant Content
Reviews must be about the location itself and not unrelated topics.
Examples:
- "I love my new phone, but this place is too noisy."
- "Politics aside, the location is nice."

## 3. No Rants Without Visit
Users must have visited the location to leave a complaint. Reviews from non-visitors should not be rants.
Examples:
- "Never been here, but I heard it’s terrible."
- "I haven’t visited, but people say it’s bad."

## 4. Valid Reviews
Reviews that are relevant, truthful, and about the location.
Examples:
- "The sushi here is amazing, and service was quick!"
- "Had a great experience at this cafe, highly recommend."
